* [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com) 3 or greater

### Recommended Environment

* PHP version 7.4 or greater

## Installation

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer, or Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Pages > Add New

## Field Mapping Guide

When configuring the Brevo integration in your Elementor form, you'll need to map your form fields to Brevo contact attributes. To do this, you need to know the **Field ID** of each form field in Elementor.

### How to Find Field IDs in Elementor

![Elementor Field ID Location](img/elementor-field-id.png)

To find the Field ID for any form field in Elementor:

1. **Edit your form** in Elementor
2. **Click on the form field** you want to map (e.g., Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
3. **Go to the Advanced tab** in the field settings
4. **Look for the "Field ID"** - this is the unique identifier you'll use in the Brevo integration
5. **Copy this Field ID** and use it in the corresponding Brevo field mapping

### Field Mapping Example

For example, if your form has:
- Name field with ID: `name`
- Email field with ID: `email` 
- Phone field with ID: `phone`

You would map these in the Brevo integration settings by entering the Field ID (e.g., `name`) in the corresponding Brevo attribute field.

**üí° Tip:** Use descriptive Field IDs like `first_name`, `email_address`, `phone_number` to make mapping easier and more maintainable.

## Multilingual Support

**ML Brevo for Elementor Pro v2.2** now includes comprehensive multilingual support with native translations for multiple languages.

### Supported Languages

- üá¨üáß **English** (default)
- üáÆüáπ **Italian** (Italiano)
- üá´üá∑ **French** (Fran√ßais)
- üá©üá™ **German** (Deutsch)
- üá™üá∏ **Spanish** (Espa√±ol)

### How Translations Work

The plugin automatically detects your WordPress site language and displays the interface in the corresponding language. All plugin interfaces are translated including:

- Admin settings pages
- Form integration controls in Elementor
- Debug logs and error messages
- Help text and documentation
- Field labels and descriptions

### Translation Management

The plugin includes a built-in **Translation Management** system accessible from the admin interface:

1. **Go to Settings > ML Brevo for Elementor Pro**
2. **Click the "Translations" tab**
3. **View translation status** for all supported languages
4. **Compile translations** for optimal performance

### Translation Files

The plugin uses WordPress standard translation system:

- **PO Files** (`.po`): Human-readable translation files that can be edited
- **MO Files** (`.mo`): Compiled binary files that WordPress uses for performance
- **POT File** (`.pot`): Template file containing all translatable strings

### Compiling Translations

For optimal performance, translation files should be compiled:

1. **Navigate to Translations tab** in plugin settings
2. **Click "Compile All Translations"** button
3. **Verify compilation status** in the translation table

The system automatically detects when translations need recompilation and provides visual indicators.

### Adding Custom Translations

To add or modify translations:

1. **Edit the `.po` file** for your language in `/languages/` directory
2. **Use translation tools** like Poedit for easier editing
3. **Compile translations** using the plugin's built-in compiler
4. **Refresh your admin page** to see changes

### Language Detection

The plugin automatically:
- Detects your WordPress site language setting
- Loads appropriate translation files
- Falls back to English if translation is unavailable
- Provides debug information when translations are enabled

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is Elementor Pro required?**

Because this integration works with the Form Widget, which is a Elementor Pro unique feature not available in the free plugin.

**Can I still use other integrations if I install this integration?**

Yes, all the other form widget integrations will be available.

**Does this also work with Brevo?**

Yes, this plugin is designed specifically for Brevo (formerly Sendinblue). The integration will work perfectly with all Brevo features.
