## Field Mapping Guide

When configuring the Brevo integration in your Elementor form, you'll need to map your form fields to Brevo contact attributes. To do this, you need to know the **Field ID** of each form field in Elementor.

### How to Find Field IDs in Elementor

![Elementor Field ID Location](img/elementor-field-id.png)

To find the Field ID for any form field in Elementor:

1. **Edit your form** in Elementor
2. **Click on the form field** you want to map (e.g., Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
3. **Go to the Advanced tab** in the field settings
4. **Look for the "Field ID"** - this is the unique identifier you'll use in the Brevo integration
5. **Copy this Field ID** and use it in the corresponding Brevo field mapping

### Field Mapping Example

For example, if your form has:
- Name field with ID: `name`
- Email field with ID: `email` 
- Phone field with ID: `phone`

You would map these in the Brevo integration settings by entering the Field ID (e.g., `name`) in the corresponding Brevo attribute field.

**üí° Tip:** Use descriptive Field IDs like `first_name`, `email_address`, `phone_number` to make mapping easier and more maintainable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is Elementor Pro required?**

Because this integration works with the Form Widget, which is a Elementor Pro unique feature not available in the free plugin.

**Can I still use other integrations if I install this integration?**

Yes, all the other form widget integrations will be available.

**Does this also work with Brevo?**

Yes, this plugin is designed specifically for Brevo (formerly Sendinblue). The integration will work perfectly with all Brevo features.
