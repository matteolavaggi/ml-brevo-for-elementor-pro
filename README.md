# ML Brevo for Elementor Pro v2.1

üöÄ **NEW in v2.1:** Enhanced user experience with list dropdown selector, unified debug system, and improved admin interface!

A lightweight but feature packed Brevo integration for Elementor forms.
With this integration you can send your form data and contacts to Brevo as easily as the standard integrations. 
Keeping performance in mind this integration doesn't add any additional scripts on page load. 
Feel free to post any feature requests and possible issues.

## Installation

### Minimum Requirements

* WordPress 5.0 or greater
* PHP version 7.0 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater
* [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com) 3 or greater

### We recommend your host supports:

* PHP version 7.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater
* WordPress Memory limit of 64 MB or greater (128 MB or higher is preferred)


## Installation

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer, or Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Pages > Add New
4. Press the 'Edit with Elementor' button.
5. Drag and drop the form widget of Elementor Pro from the left panel onto the content area, and find the Brevo action in the "Actions after submit" dropdown.
6. Fill your Brevo data and Key and you are all set. All users will be added after they submit the form.

## Field Mapping Guide

When configuring the Brevo integration in your Elementor form, you'll need to map your form fields to Brevo contact attributes. To do this, you need to know the **Field ID** of each form field in Elementor.

### How to Find Field IDs in Elementor

![Elementor Field ID Location](img/elementor-field-id.png)

To find the Field ID for any form field in Elementor:

1. **Edit your form** in Elementor
2. **Click on the form field** you want to map (e.g., Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
3. **Go to the Advanced tab** in the field settings
4. **Look for the "Field ID"** - this is the unique identifier you'll use in the Brevo integration
5. **Copy this Field ID** and use it in the corresponding Brevo field mapping

### Field Mapping Example

For example, if your form has:
- Name field with ID: `name`
- Email field with ID: `email` 
- Phone field with ID: `phone`

You would map these in the Brevo integration settings by entering the Field ID (e.g., `name`) in the corresponding Brevo attribute field.

**üí° Tip:** Use descriptive Field IDs like `first_name`, `email_address`, `phone_number` to make mapping easier and more maintainable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is Elementor Pro required?**

Because this integration works with the Form Widget, which is a Elementor Pro unique feature not available in the free plugin.

**Can I still use other integrations if I install this integration?**

Yes, all the other form widget integrations will be available.

**Does this also work with Brevo?**

Yes, this plugin is designed specifically for Brevo (formerly Sendinblue). The integration will work perfectly with all Brevo features.
